# **A Practical Cost of Living Tool for Teenagers, Adults, or Anyone In Between**

## **Inspiration and Purpose**
Transitioning from high school to adulthood is one of the most uncertain steps young people face. As a high school senior preparing to enter college and the broader world, I’ve often found myself overwhelmed by the financial realities that come with independence: rent, food, transportation, and countless other costs that most teenagers haven’t yet had to navigate on their own. When talking with others my age, the sentiment is the same: how am I supposed to know how much money I need to make to live the life I want? Where does that money get allocated in said life?  
This project, a React app that filters U.S. cities based on the user’s budget, grew directly out of those fears. Instead of vague guesses or browsing random cost-of-living websites, I wanted a simple, focused tool: one where students like me could input a projected budget and instantly see which cities realistically match their financial situation. As I prepare for college and think about internships, job placements, and eventually full-time life after graduation, having a concrete starting point makes the future feel a little less uncertain. This app is the kind of resource I wish had been handed to me freshman year, and now, as a senior, I’m building it for others who may feel the same pressures.

## **Why This Project** Matters: Readiness, Reality, and Student Perspectives
The importance of a tool like this becomes clear when looking at broader student attitudes toward adulthood. Surveys from organizations such as the Pew Research Center and the American Psychological Association regularly show that teenagers and college students feel underprepared for financial independence. While the exact statistics vary across studies, the underlying trend is consistent: young people report high confidence in their academic abilities but low confidence in managing real-world responsibilities, especially money.  
A 2023 Junior Achievement survey, for example, found that over 54% of high school seniors feel anxious about their ability to support themselves financially after graduation. Another study from Sallie Mae reported that only about one-third of college students feel confident in understanding their own budgets, cost of living, or how far their future salaries will stretch. Students may know how to solve integrals or write essays, but very few are taught how to compare rent in Denver vs. St. Louis, or how much income is required to live comfortably in Los Angeles versus Cleveland.  
For many, especially people who prefer going into things with a solid foundation for a plan, this lack of preparedness translates into real stress. College freshmen often move away from home without a clear picture of local expenses. Upperclassmen searching for internships worry whether the salaries offered can support them in different parts of the country. Seniors applying for jobs struggle to decide where they can realistically afford to live. The pressure compounds with the feeling that they “should already know” these things, especially when influencers and online narratives glamorize big-city living without explaining the price tag behind it.  
That’s where this project fits in. By presenting income-based city filtering in a straightforward and intuitive interface, the app helps bridge the gap between classroom learning and adult life. It acts as an early decision-making tool: not a perfect predictor of one’s future, but a grounding reference point for planning. It can reduce stress for students who feel unprepared and it encourages a more informed approach to choosing colleges, internships, and even long-term career paths. When students have clear, accessible numbers in front of them, the abstract fear of “not being ready for life” becomes more manageable and less mysterious.  
Ultimately, the significance of this project goes beyond just a simple app. It aims to be a tool in the lives of incoming or current college students (or anyone younger or older who wants a plan) and guide them through the ever-changing and frankly daunting world that is life in the United States.

## **How the App Works: Technical Overview**
The application itself is built with React, using a local CSV dataset containing thousands of U.S. cities and their corresponding median household incomes. The user inputs their projected monthly budget in different areas, which the app converts into a comparable yearly figure. From there, the app creates a range around this yearly figure to determine which cities fall close to the user’s income level.  
Because the dataset includes towns, villages, and small jurisdictions, the app filters strictly for entries categorized as cities. Once the filtering is done, the results are returned as a clean, scrollable list of cities that match the user’s financial situation. The system is optimized to avoid manually scanning thousands of entries; instead, it loads the CSV once, parses it into JavaScript objects, and uses efficient array methods to perform real-time filtering with each input change.
