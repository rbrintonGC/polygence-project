# polygence-project

This Project serves as a possible starting point for developing and organizing your life. I built this because I know that, as a high school senior, going into life as an adult is scary and, at times, daunting. However, I know the first step to building something successful at any scale is to plan it out as best as possible; this app intends to help with that. The app centers around estimating budgets for different areas of your life (insurance, groceries, etc.) and calculates the necessary yearly income to support that lifestyle. Using a data set of over 30,000 cities and information about them, the app selects a few options of places to live in the United States. Throughout the development of the app, I learned a lot about the pros and cons of different languages and coding environments, and the amount of/distribution of work that actually goes into creating an app, even one this size.
